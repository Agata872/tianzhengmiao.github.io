<h2>GNN-based Precoding for Cell-free Massive MIMO</h2>
<p>This project explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to design and fine-tune precoders in a cell-free massive MIMO system using real-world channel state information (CSI) gathered from our 6G testbed.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Conventional linear precoding approaches struggle with distributed deployments and real CSI irregularities. We aim to learn flexible, robust precoding mappings using data-driven methods.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>The proposed approach models the network as a graph, where Access Points (APs) and Users are nodes. A multi-layer GNN architecture learns to output precoding weights based on node and edge features.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Performance improves over traditional MRT and ZF in realistic deployments.</li>
  <li>Transfer learning enables cross-scenario generalization with minimal fine-tuning.</li>
</ul>
